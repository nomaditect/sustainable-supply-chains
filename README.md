a geospatial data analysis on sustainable supply chain networks.

The aim of this project is to use geospatial data analysis techniques to try and track multinational corporations (MNC's).

## Project Description
The project sets out a potentially unrealistic role of trying to map a story that does not want to be told. When it comes to multipnational corporations (MNC's) they are trained in the art of diversion and distraction, like a magician and his slight of hand, MNC's use 3rd/4th/5th party traders to do their dirty work. 

## Hypothesis
Can one map a MNC's supply chain with publicly accesible information?

## Tools
The project used python as a tool for data extraction, scraping and cleaning, with Tableau for visualizations and conceptual layouts, while the final artboards were put together in Adobe Illustrator.

## Sources (data)
The Nike dataset was publicly avaliable on the website.


## Method (Analysis)
Using a combination of public data, web scraping and academic reports the project combines multiple forms of medium an attempt to carve the story of a global supply chain network, masked multi national corporations.

## Conclusion
The ability to trace articles back to their source or roots can be a complex problem face with many barriers and firewalls. The truth is companies don't really want you to know where their products come from and who is involved in the manufaturing process. Good Luck to the next challenger....
